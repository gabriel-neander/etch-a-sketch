# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a simple implementation of the Etch-a-Sketch game created as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.

## Overview

Etch-a-Sketch is a drawing game where you can create colorful designs by "drawing" on a grid using your cursor. As you move your cursor over the grid, it leaves a trail of color, allowing you to create various patterns and drawings.

## Features

- Adjustable grid size: Choose the size of the grid to create larger or smaller drawings.
- Pen colors: Select from a range of colors to draw with.
- Rainbow mode: Enable rainbow mode to cycle through a variety of colors as you draw.
- Clear the grid: Quickly clear the entire grid to start a new drawing.

## How to Play

1. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
2. Use your cursor to move over the grid to draw.
3. Select a pen color by clicking the color buttons.
4. Toggle rainbow mode by clicking the "Go Rainbows!" button.
5. Clear the grid by clicking the "Clear" button.
